# Function Pointers in C

Function pointers are a powerful and advanced feature of the C programming language that enable you to treat functions as variables. Function pointers allow you to dynamically select and call functions during runtime, making your code more flexible and adaptable.

## Introduction

In C, functions are essentially blocks of code that can be called by their names. Function pointers take this a step further, allowing you to store and manipulate the addresses of functions, treating functions as data.

## Declaring Function Pointers

A function pointer's declaration resembles a function's signature, but with an additional asterisk (*) indicating it's a pointer:

```c
return_type (*pointer_name)(parameter_type1, parameter_type2, ...);
