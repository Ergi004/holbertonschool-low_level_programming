Readme: Nested Loops, Functions, Variable Scope, Header Files, and GCC Flags
This readme provides a concise overview of nested loops, functions, variable scope, header files, and GCC flags in programming.

Nested Loops
Nested loops are used to perform repetitive tasks within another loop, enabling iteration over multi-dimensional data structures or complex pattern-based computations.

Functions
Functions are self-contained blocks of code that perform specific tasks, promoting code modularity and reusability. They require declaration and definition, allowing code to be divided into smaller units for better organization.

Variable Scope
Variables can have local or global scope. Local variables are declared within a specific block or function, offering encapsulation and preventing naming conflicts. Global variables, declared outside any function, are accessible throughout the entire program.

Header Files and #include
Header files contain function prototypes, definitions, and declarations shared across multiple source files. They are included in programs using the #include directive, promoting modularity, code reuse, and organized code development.

GCC Flags: -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
GCC flags are used with the GNU Compiler Collection. The -Wall flag enables all warning messages, -Werror treats warnings as errors, -pedantic enforces strict adherence to standard programming practices, -Wextra enables extra warning messages, and -std=gnu89 specifies the C language standard to use.

By understanding and utilizing these concepts, developers can write efficient, modular, and well-organized code while leveraging the power of the GCC compiler for enhanced development and error detection.
