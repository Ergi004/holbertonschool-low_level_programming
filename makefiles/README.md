README.md: Makefiles, Rules, Variables
This README.md provides a brief overview of Makefiles, rules, and variables in programming.

Make and Makefiles: Make is a build automation tool, and Makefiles specify build rules.

When, Why, and How to Use Makefiles: Use Makefiles for multi-file projects, automating compilation, and managing dependencies. Create a "Makefile" and define rules to build the project.

Rules: Define dependencies and commands to build targets in Makefiles.

Setting and Using Rules: Specify targets, prerequisites, and commands to build them.

Explicit and Implicit Rules: Explicit rules directly define how to build a target, while implicit rules have generic patterns.

Common/Useful Rules: Include all (build all), clean (remove files), install (install program).

Variables: Store reusable values in Makefiles, such as flags or file names.

Setting and Using Variables: Assign values to variables using = or :=, reference them using $().

Automate builds, manage dependencies, and enhance project development using Makefiles, rules, and variables.
