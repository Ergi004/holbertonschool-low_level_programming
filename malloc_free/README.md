In C programming, malloc is a function used to dynamically allocate memory on the heap. It stands for "memory allocation" and is declared in the stdlib.h header file.

When you call malloc, you provide the number of bytes you want to allocate as an argument. The function then searches for a block of memory in the heap that is large enough to accommodate your request.

If a suitable block of memory is found, malloc reserves that memory and returns a pointer to the starting address of the allocated memory block. This pointer can be used to access the allocated memory.

It's important to note that you need to free the allocated memory using the free function when you're done with it to avoid memory leaks. Failing to do so can lead to inefficient memory usage and potential program crashes.
