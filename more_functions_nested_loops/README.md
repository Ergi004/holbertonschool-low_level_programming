README.md: Nested Loops, Functions, Variables, GCC Flags, Header Files
This README.md provides a concise overview of nested loops, functions, variables, GCC flags, and header files in programming.

Nested Loops: Perform repetitive tasks within another loop for multi-dimensional data structures or complex computations.

Functions: Self-contained blocks of code that perform specific tasks. Declare, define, and call them for code modularity.

Declaration vs. Definition of a Function: Declaration provides info without implementation. Definition includes implementation.

Prototype: Forward declaration providing name, return type, and parameters of a function.

Variable Scope: Variables have local or global scope. Local within a block/function, global accessible throughout the program.

GCC Flags (-Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89): GCC flags for warnings, errors, adherence to standards.

Header Files and #include: Include shared function prototypes, definitions, macros, and declarations using #include.

Utilize these concepts for efficient and modular code, effective debugging, and seamless integration of libraries.
