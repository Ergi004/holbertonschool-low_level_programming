# Nested Loops in C: Exploring More Complex Nesting

Nested loops in C allow you to iterate over multiple dimensions of data, enabling you to work with multidimensional arrays, matrices, and other complex data structures. This README explains how to effectively use nested loops for more intricate looping patterns.

## Introduction

A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. They are often used to iterate over two-dimensional arrays or to perform tasks where iterations are required within certain constraints.

## Basic Nested Loop

Here's a simple example of a nested loop to print a multiplication table:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= 10; j++) {
            printf("%4d", i * j);
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
Pattern Printing
Nested loops can be used to print various patterns:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
    int n = 5;
    for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (int j = 1; j <= i; j++) {
            printf("* ");
        }
        printf("\n");
    }
    return 0;
}
Nested Loops with Arrays
Nested loops are often used to work with two-dimensional arrays:

c
Copy code
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
