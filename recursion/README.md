# Recursion in C

Recursion is a powerful programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a problem. In C, recursion can be used to break down complex problems into simpler sub-problems, making the code more elegant and easier to understand.

## Introduction

Recursion is a process in which a function calls itself as a subroutine. It's often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar sub-problems. Each recursive call works on a smaller instance of the problem, and the results are combined to solve the larger problem.

## Termination Condition

Every recursive function must have a termination condition, also known as the base case. The base case defines when the recursion should stop. Without a proper base case, the recursive function can lead to infinite recursion and cause a stack overflow.

## Basic Structure

A recursive function typically follows this basic structure:

```c
return_type function_name(parameters) {
    // Base case
    if (base_case_condition) {
        return base_case_value;
    }
    
    // Recursive case
    return recursive_call(arguments);
}
