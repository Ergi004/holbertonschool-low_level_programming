# Singly Linked Lists in C

A singly linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, each of which contains a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next element in the sequence. Singly linked lists are widely used for dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion and deletion of elements.

## Introduction

In a singly linked list, each element (node) contains two components: the value it holds and a reference to the next element. The last element's reference points to NULL, indicating the end of the list. Singly linked lists are especially useful when elements are frequently inserted or removed from the list.

## Advantages of Singly Linked Lists

- **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Singly linked lists allow dynamic memory allocation, as each node can be allocated and deallocated separately.
- **Insertions and Deletions**: Insertion and deletion of nodes at the beginning or specific positions are efficient operations.
- **Memory Efficiency**: Singly linked lists can save memory compared to arrays when the number of elements is uncertain and can grow or shrink over time.

## Basic Operations

- **Initialization**: Initialize an empty singly linked list with a pointer to the head node.
- **Insertion**: Add a new node to the list at the beginning, end, or at a specific position.
- **Deletion**: Remove a node from the list while maintaining the linkage.
- **Search**: Find a node with a specific value or meet certain criteria.
- **Traversal**: Iterate through the list to process or display elements.

## Traversal

Traversing a singly linked list involves following the references from one node to the next until the end is reached. Here's an example of how to traverse a singly linked list in C:

```c
struct Node {
    int data;
    struct Node* next;
};

void traverse(struct Node* head) {
    struct Node* current = head;
    while (current != NULL) {
        // Process current node
        current = current->next;
    }
}
