## Introduction

In C, a structure is a composite data type that groups together variables of different data types under a single name. Each variable within a structure is called a member or field. `typedef` is a C keyword used to create aliases for existing data types, making the code more readable and easier to maintain.

## Structures

A structure declaration defines a blueprint for creating instances of that structure. Each instance is called an object. Here's an example of a structure declaration:

```c
struct Person {
    char name[50];
    int age;
    float height;
};
