README.md: Operators, Statements, Variables, Loops, ASCII, GCC Flags
This README.md provides a brief overview of operators, statements, variables, loops, ASCII, and GCC flags in C programming.

Arithmetic Operators: Perform math operations (+, -, *, /) on numerical values.

Logical Operators: Combine conditions with AND (&&), OR (||), NOT (!).

Relational Operators: Compare values with equal to (==), not equal to (!=), greater than (>), less than (<).

TRUE and FALSE Values: Non-zero values are TRUE, zero is FALSE.

Boolean Operators: Perform logic operations on Booleans (&, |, ~).

if and if...else Statements: Control program flow based on conditions.

Comments: Add notes or disable code with // or /* */.

Variable Declaration: Define char, int, unsigned int variables.

Variable Assignment: Assign values using (=).

Printing Variables with printf: Display variable values with printf.

While Loop: Execute code while a condition is true.

Using Variables with While Loop: Update variables within the loop.

Printing Variables with printf: Display changing variable values.

ASCII Character Set: Character encoding standard.

GCC Flags -m32 and -m64: Specify compilation target architecture.

Explore these concepts for efficient coding, calculations, and control flow in C programs.
