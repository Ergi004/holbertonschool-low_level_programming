# Variadic Functions in C

Variadic functions are a powerful feature in C that allow you to define functions that can take a variable number of arguments. This flexibility is particularly useful when you need to create functions that can accept a varying number of inputs, such as `printf` and `scanf` from the standard library.

## Introduction

In C, functions with a variable number of arguments are called variadic functions. The standard C library provides the `printf`, `scanf`, and `fprintf` functions as common examples of variadic functions.

## Advantages of Variadic Functions

- **Flexibility**: Variadic functions can handle a varying number of arguments, making them versatile for functions with different numbers of parameters.
- **Simplicity**: Variadic functions can simplify your code by allowing a single function to handle multiple scenarios without having to define separate functions for each case.
- **Standard Library Support**: Many standard library functions, such as `printf`, use variadic arguments to provide versatile formatting capabilities.

## Defining Variadic Functions

To define a variadic function, you use an ellipsis `...` as the last parameter in the parameter list of the function. For example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdarg.h>

void exampleVariadicFunction(int fixedArg, ...) {
    // Variadic function implementation
}
